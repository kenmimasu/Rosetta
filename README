################################################################################
Rosetta is a translation tool to aid in the Monte Carlo generation of events for
Higgs Effective Field Theory. The idea is to provide a simple way to map 
different parametrisations of the deviations of Higgs couplings from SM 
expectations to a single 'basis' of Wilson coefficients corresponding to 
operators up to dimension 6.

Given an LHA style input parameter card in the users basis of choice, Rosetta 
has the capability to read in the parameters, calculate any dependent 
parameters, perform a number of consistency checks with respect to required and 
derived inputs and finally write out a new parameter card in the target basis 
which can be used as input to the associated UFO model in e.g. 
MadGraph5_aMC@NLO. 

The tool consists of a Python package containing implementations of 
Higgs Effective Theory bases and a command line tool 'translate' that performs 
the task of mapping a given basis to a target output basis. The core of the 
package is based on the contents of the LHCHiggs Cross Section Working Group 
(HXSWG) draft. The slides at
https://indico.cern.ch/event/375176/contribution/5/material/slides/0.pdf 
provide a more detailed description of the tool as well as some examples of 
usage and the code structure (see backup slides).

Usage
################################################################################
The translate command line tool takes an LHA-style param card (see sample 
cards provided in Cards/ directory) in a particular basis and outputs a new 
card in the specified basis (default is Mass Basis). So far, only the Mass 
Basis can be takes as the target basis. 

The options BLOCKIN and BLOCKOUT allow the user to specify the name of the LHA 
block that contains the new couplings. The names of these couplings, specified 
as the first non-whitespace characters following a hash ("#") character after 
the numerical value of the parameter, should match those defined in the 
'independent' list of the specified input basis.

Input cards
################################################################################
Rosetta is designed to read input cards in a format similar to the SUSY Les 
Houches Accord (SLHA) detailed in http://arxiv.org/abs/hep-ph/0311123. It 
coincides with the input format read in by Madgraph5_aMC@NLO. Sample cards can 
be found in the Cards/ directory. 

The reader looks for block structures in a case insensitive way i.e.

>>BLOCK MYBLOCK

Specifically it will search for blocks MASS, SMINPUTS and BASIS. For the 
Higgs Effective Theory couplings, it will also search for a block 'newcoup' or 
any other string BLOCKIN specified by the '-b BLOCKIN' option of translate.

The main difference between the input format of Rosetta and SLHA is that names 
of parameters are required as this is what the translator uses to identify them 
in applying the translation formulae. This was deemed to be clearer than the 
usual numerical ordering that would be more suitable for automatically 
generated input cards. Therefore each parameter in blocks SMINPUTS and BLOCKIN 
should be accompanied by a name following a '#' character (usually reserved for 
comments describing the parameter).

>>BLOCK MYBLOCK
>>  0 3.14159E+00 # pi
>>  1 1.97327E-01 # hbarc_GeVfm
>>  Block sminputs 
>>      1   1.325070e+02       #    aEWM1  (white space doesn't matter)
ETC.

The reader reads all lines until the next occurrence of 'BLOCK' or 'DECAY', 
ignoring leading and trailing white space and all lines beginning with a '#' as 
well as lines that do not match the expected pattern detailed above. For blocks 
BLOCKIN and SMINPUTS, the reader stores a name:value pair in the ordered 
dictionaries self.par_dict and self.input respectively. For block MASS, a 
PID:mass pair is stored in self.mass

>> block mass 
>>     5 4.700000e+00 # MB 
>>     6 1.730000e+02 # MT 
>>    15 1.730000e+02 # MTAU
>>    23 9.118800e+01 # MZ 
>>    25 1.250000e+02 # MH 

Block basis should have one element and is simply a label for the users input 
basis, it is not essential but is used when writing out the new to remind the 
user from which basis they translated.

>> block BASIS
>> 0 MyBasis # name of basis

################################################################################
Implementing your own basis
################################################################################
Users who wish to implement their own basis should have a minimal understanding 
of implementing formulae and assigning variables in python dictionaries. The 
TemplateBasis.py class illustrates a toy implementation of a basis containing 
the main ingredients necessary.

The base class Basis.py implements a number of reading and writing functions 
designed to remain 'under the hood'.These include reading and writing parameter 
cards, cross checking inputs read in against required inputs, storing the old 
parameter card and writing out a new one with the coefficients of the target 
basis. In general, the only variables needed in a derived class will be the 
following useful data members:

    self.independent        # A list of coefficients required to be defined 
                            # in the input parameter card.

    self.dependent          # A list of dependent coefficients to be assigned 
                            # by the calculate_dependent() function. These 
                            # should not be declared in the input parameter
                            # card.

    self.required_inputs    # A set of required input parameters in block 
                            # SMINPUTS

    self.required_masses    # A set of required article masses in block MASS

    self.par_dict           # dictionary with keys defined by self.independent 
                            # and self.dependent. The parameters in  
                            # self.independent will be read in from the 
                            # input parameter card while those in self.dependent
                            # should be calculated and assigned by the user in 
                            # calculate_dependent().
                            
    self.input              # dictionary with names and values of parameters 
                            # defined in block SMINPUTS. Cross checked with 
                            # self.required_inputs
                            
    self.mass               # dictionary with PIDs and particle masses defined 
                            # in block MASS. Cross checked with elements of
                            # self.required_masses

    self.newpar             # dictionary of coefficients to be filled in  
                            # translate() function. The contents of this 
                            # dictionary are written out to the output parameter
                            # card in place of the old basis coefficients of the
                            #  input parameter card.

    self.newmass            # dictionary of parameters to be filled in
                            # translate() function

The basic steps are as follows:

1)  Create a new file MyBasis.py declaring a class MyBasis inheriting from the 
    Basis class (these names need not coincide). The target basis class can 
    also be imported in order to initialise an empty container to fill in the 
    translate function.
    
    >>from Basis import Basis # base class
    >>from MassBasis import MassBasis # target basis
    >>
    >>class TemplateBasis(Basis):

2)  Minimally, a list of strings called 'independent' should be declared 
    containing the names of the coefficients to be read in the input parameter 
    card and used to calculate the coefficients in the target basis. 
    Additionally, a list named 'dependent' can also (optionally) be defined 
    containing the names of coefficients to calculate internally before 
    translating to the target basis.
    For more consistency, the sets 'required_inputs' and 'required_masses' 
    can also be declared. These tell the basis class to check that the masses 
    of particles with certain PIDs and certain SM input parameters are defined 
    in the blocks MASS and SMINPUTS respectively. If default values exist for 
    these parameters in __init__.py, the user is asked if they wish to continue 
    using those when calling ./translate.
    
    >>class MyBasis(Basis):
    >>    independent = ['a','b','c',...] # list of required parameters
    >>    dependent = ['d','e','f',...]   # list of derived parameters
    >>    required_masses = {1,2,3,4,5,6,...} # PIDs of required particle masses
    >>    required_inputs = {'aEWM1','MZ',...} # required SMINPUT parameters
    
3)  At least the function translate() should be defined that applies the map 
    from the input coefficients to those in the output basis. This can be done 
    by creating and instance of the target basis class and filling its par_dict 
    data member. The function should ultimately assign the dictionary to 
    self.newpar. self.newname can also be assigned.
    The function calculate_dependent() can also be defined which to calculate 
    values of the coefficients declared in 'dependent' and assign them in 
    self.par_dict.The dictionary self.newmass can also be modified at any 
    stage if modifications to particle masses occur. This should be a 
    dictionary of PID:mass pairs that will replace the entries in self.mass.
    
    >>    def calculate_dependent(self):
    >>        '''
    >>        Calculate dependent parameters here by assigning values 
    >>        to self.par_dict corresponding to the keys in self.dependent.
    >>        '''
    >>        p = self.par_dict
    >>        p['d'] = p['a']+ p['b']*p['c'] # set a value for 'd' coefficient
    >>
    >>    def translate(self):
    >>        '''
    >>        Translate to the mass basis by creating an empty MassBasis 
    >>        and modifying its par_dict or coeffs._asdict().
    >>        Set self.newpar with resulting dictionary
    >>        '''
    >>        A = self.coeffs._asdict()
    >>        # initialise empty par_dict of the target basis instance
    >>        B = MassBasis().coeffs._asdict() 
    >>        # set all values of coeffs according to nonsense formula: 
    >>        # C = coeff_d * m_top / a_EW
    >>        for k in B.keys(): 
    >>            B[k]=A['d']*self.mass[6]/self.input['aEWM1']
    >>        self.newpar = B
    >>        self.newname = 'Mass'

4)  Once the translate() function has been defined, the implementation is 
    complete and can be tested with the translate tool. The new basis should be 
    added to the dictionary 'bases' in implemented.py in order to make the tool 
    aware of its existence. This is done by importing the new module and 
    appending it to the dictionary.
    
    In implemented.py:
    
    >>import WarsawBasis, HiggsBasis, MassBasis, TemplateBasis
    >>import MyBasis
    
    >> bases['mybasis'] = MyBasis.MyBasis
    
    The options for ./translate -h should now include "mybasis" as a possible
    BASIS argument.
