Usage
##########
The translate command line tool takes an LHA-style param card 
(see template cards provided in Cards/) in a particular basis 
and outputs a new card in the specified basis (default is Mass 
Basis). So far, only the Mass Basis can be takes as the target 
basis. 
The options BLOCKIN and BLOCKOUT allow the user to specify 
the name of the LHA block that contains the new couplings. 
The names of these couplings, specified as the first 
non-whitespace characters following a hash ("#") character 
after the numerical value of the parameter, should match 
those defined in the 'independent' list of the specified 
input basis.

    Command line documentation:
    
    >> ./translate --help
    
    usage: translate [-h] [-o OUTPUT] [-b BLOCKIN] [-B BLOCKOUT] [-t TARGETBASIS]

Implementing your own basis
##########
Users who wish to implement their own basis should have a 
minimal understanding of implementing formulae and assigning 
variables in python dictionaries. The TemplateBasis.py class 
illustrates a toy implementation of a nonsense basis with 
the main ingredients of a custom basis.

The base class Basis.py implements a number of reading 
and writing functions designed to remain 'under the hood'.
These inlcude reading and writing parameter cards, cross 
checking inputs read in against required inputs, storing 
the old parameter card and writing out a new one with 
the coefficients of the target basis. In general, the 
only variables needed in a derived class will be the 
following useful data members:

    self.independent        # A list of coefficients required to be defined 
                            # in the input parameter card.

    self.dependent          # A list of dependent coefficients to be assigned 
                            # by the calculate_dependent() function. These 
                            # should not be declared in the input parameter card.

    self.required_inputs    # A set of required input parameters in block SMINPUTS

    self.required_masses    # A set of required article masses in block MASS

    self.par_dict           # dictionary with keys defined by self.independent 
                            # and self.dependent. The parameters in self.independent 
                            # will be read in from the input parameter card while 
                            # those in self.dependent should be calculated and 
                            # assigned by the user in calculate_dependent().
                            
    self.input              # dictionary with names and values of parameters defined 
                            # in block SMINPUT. Cross checked with self.required_inputs
                            
    self.mass               # dictionary with PIDs and particle masses defined 
                            # in block MASS. Cross checked with self.required_masses

    self.newpar             # dictionary of coefficients to be filled in translate() 
                            # function. The contents of this dictionary are written 
                            # out to the output parameter card in place of the old 
                            # basis coefficients of the input parameter card.

    self.newmass            # dictionary of parameters to be filled in translate() 
                            # function

The basic steps are as follows:

1)  Create a new file MyBasis.py declaring a class MyBasis 
    inheriting from the Basis class (these names need not 
    coincide). The target basis class can also be imported 
    in order to initialise an empty container to fill 
    in the translate function.
    
    >>from Basis import Basis # base class
    >>from MassBasis import MassBasis # target basis
    >>
    >>class TemplateBasis(Basis):

2)  Minimally, a list of strings called 'independent' should 
    be declared conatining the names of the coefficients to 
    be read in the input parameter card and used to calculate 
    the coefficients in the target basis. 
    Additionally, a list named 'dependent' can also (optionally) 
    be defined containing the names of coefficients to calculate 
    internally before translating to the target basis.
    For more consistency, the sets 'required_inputs' and 
    'required_masses' can also be declared. These tell the basis 
    class to check that the masses of particles with certain 
    PIDs and certain SM input parameters are defined in the 
    blocks MASS and SMINPUTS respectively. If default values 
    exist for these parameters in __init__.py, the user 
    is asked if they wish to continue using those when calling 
    ./translate.
    
    >>class TemplateBasis(Basis):
    >>    independent = ['a','b','c',...] # list of required independent coefficients
    >>    dependent = ['d','e','f',...] # list of dependent coefficients to be calculated
    >>    required_masses = {1,2,3,4,5,6}
    >>    required_inputs = {'aEWM1','MZ'}
    
3)  At least the function translate() should be defined that 
    applies the map from the input coefficients to those in 
    the output basis. This can be done by creating and instance 
    of the target basis class and filling its par_dict data member. 
    The function should ultimately assign the dictionary to 
    self.newpar. self.newname can also be assigned.
    The function calculate_dependent() can also be defined which 
    to calculate values of the coefficients declared in 'dependent' 
    and assign them in self.par_dict.
    The dictionary self.newmass can also be modified at any stage 
    if modifications to particle masses occur. This should be a 
    dictionary of PID:mass pairs that will replace the entries 
    in self.mass.

    >>        '''
    >>        Calculate dependent parameters here by assigning values to self.par_dict 
    >>        corresponding to the keys in self.dependent.
    >>        '''
    >>        p = self.par_dict
    >>        p['d'] = p['a']+ p['b']*p['c'] # set a value for 'd' coefficient
    >>
    >>    def translate(self):
    >>        '''
    >>        Translate to the mass basis by creating an empty MassBasis and modifying its par_dict or coeffs._asdict()
    >>        set self.newpar with resulting par_dict
    >>        '''
    >>        A = self.coeffs._asdict()
    >>        B = MassBasis().coeffs._asdict() # initialise empty par_dict of the target basis instance
    >>        for k in B.keys(): # set all values of coeffs according to nonsense formula coeff_a*m_top/a_EW
    >>            B[k]=A['d']*self.mass[6]/self.input['aEWM1']
    >>        self.newpar = B
    >>        self.newname = 'Mass'
